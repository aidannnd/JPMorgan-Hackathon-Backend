# jpmorgan-hackathon-backend
My portion of a team project built for JP Morgan's Code For Good hackathon in 2020. 

This backend is a Python API built with Flask-RESTPlus connected to a Firebase Cloud Firestore database.

This API uses the Firebase API to directly add, delete, and modify data within the database. To do this, download and place the 'key.json' file in the project's source folder (directions: rb.gy/nosksb). Run the 'app.py' file and interact with the database through the SwaggerUI, the app assumes it's accessing a collection specified in the 'users_ref' variable in config.py.
